# Learning-Linux
This repository contains my journey from ground up. I am going to use LLMs to practise as much as I can, as accelerate my learning of the said topic. I have prompted Deepseek in "Hitchhiker's Guide to galaxy" way to keep things intersting. On a second note I am not going to sprint on this particular table of content because I want to learn linux for DevOps projects. So it would be best for me learn things when I would be needing it rather than learning it in one go.
