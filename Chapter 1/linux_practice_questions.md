## **Pro Tips for Practicing**  
1. **Experiment**: Donâ€™t be afraid to break things. Thatâ€™s how you learn.  
2. **Use `man`**: If youâ€™re stuck, read the manual. Itâ€™s your best friend.  
3. **Google is Your Friend**: If youâ€™re really stuck, search for solutions. Just donâ€™t copy-paste blindly.  
4. **Practice Daily**: Linux is a skill, and like any skill, it improves with practice.
